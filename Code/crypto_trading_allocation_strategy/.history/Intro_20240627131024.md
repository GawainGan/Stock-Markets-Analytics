# Capital Allocation Strategy Based on Trend Calculations

## Overview

The capital allocation strategy uses trend-following techniques to determine the optimal allocation of capital across four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE). The strategy aims to maximize returns by dynamically adjusting the weights assigned to each asset based on their performance metrics, including Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and Sharpe Ratios.

## Files and Functions

The strategy consists of the following Python scripts and their respective functions:

1. **`update_dataframe.py`**
2. **`sharpe_ratio_utils.py`**
3. **`grid_search.py`**
4. **`trading_strategy_utils.py`**

Each script contains functions that are critical to the implementation of the strategy. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### 1. `trading_strategy_utils.py`

This script contains utility functions to calculate EMAs, signals, and other financial indicators.
使用双EMA的主要思路是我们的pnl在形态上本身处于一个上下震荡的状态，我们希望通过EMA的计算来捕捉到这种震荡的趋势。

同时，由于我们要对附加的allocation [0 -1]，因此我的理解是，我们需要关注如何在pnl上下震荡的情况下，找到正向趋势的信号，从而对allocation进行调整。因此，`calculate_signal`可以帮助我们识别Golden Cross(signal == 1)，然后再结合其他的条件决定下一条PnL数据是否**应该赋予weight from the allocation**。

The `calculate_count` aims to track the consecutive occurrences of positive signals in the trading data. This strategy helps in identifying how often positive signals occur in succession, which can be useful in determining the strength and reliability of a trend.

The `calculate_consistency` aims to evaluate the consistency of the signals over time and identify whether they form a continuous pattern. 在很多情况下，PnL的连续性可以保证一段利润的最大化，即allocation可以在稳健的连续性中不断加码，直到出现转折信号（在这里特指失去连续性）。This strategy helps in assessing the reliability of the signals and their ability to sustain over multiple periods. 


The `calculate_weight_and_class` function is designed to dynamically adjust weights and classify signals based on specific conditions. This strategy helps to fine-tune the weight applied to signals, taking into account their positivity, signal direction, and continuity.

Reason I choose this strategy:
1.	**Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Adjusts weights based on real-time signal conditions, allowing for more responsive and adaptive trading decisions.
2.	**Detailed Signal Classification**: Provides a clear classification of signals, helping to differentiate between strong, moderate, and weak signals.
3.	**Enhanced Decision-Making**: By considering factors like signal positivity, direction, and continuity, the strategy supports more informed and nuanced trading decisions.
4.	**Ease of Implementation**: The function is simple to implement and integrate into existing trading systems.
5.	**Scalability**: Can be easily scaled and adapted for different trading assets or markets by adjusting the parameters and conditions.

However, the strategy may have limitations in certain market conditions, such as high volatility or sudden price changes, which could impact the effectiveness of the signal classification and weight adjustment process. Additionally, the strategy may require frequent monitoring and adjustment to optimize performance and adapt to changing market conditions.

**Key Functions:**

- **`calculate_ema(df, short_window=6, long_window=12)`**
- **`calculate_is_positive(df)`**
- **`calculate_ema_diff(df)`**
- **`calculate_signal(df)`**
- **`calculate_count(df)`**
- **`calculate_consistency(df)`**
- **`calculate_weight_and_class(df, true_weight=1, high_weight=100, medium_weight=65, low_weight=30)`**

### 2. `update_dataframe.py`

This script contains functions to update the DataFrame with new rows and compute the necessary financial indicators.

**Key Functions:**

- **`update_dataframe_with_new_row(df_new, new_row, results_list, short_window=7, long_window=15, true_weight=1, high_weight=100, medium_weight=65, low_weight=30)`**

    Updates the DataFrame with a new row and calculates EMA, signal, and weight.

### 3. `grid_search.py`

This script contains functions for performing grid search to optimize parameters.

**Key Functions:**

- **`grid_search_2_params(btc_df, short_window_range, long_window_range)`**

    Performs grid search to find the best parameters for short and long EMAs.

### 4. `sharpe_ratio_utils.py`

This script contains functions to calculate the Sharpe Ratio and allocate weights based on Sharpe Ratios.

**Key Functions:**

- **`calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.01)`**

    Calculates the Sharpe Ratio for a series of returns.

- **`calculate_true_weights(sharpe_ratios)`**

    Allocates true weights to each cryptocurrency based on their Sharpe Ratios.

## Strategy Execution

The strategy is executed through the `evaluate_strategy` function, which iterates over historical data, updates the DataFrames, and calculates the allocation for each cryptocurrency.

**Key Steps:**

### 1. Initialization and Data Preparation

```python
cumulative_return = 1
date_range = pd.date_range(start='2022-10-01 00:00:00', end='2022-11-10 00:00:00', freq='H')
date_strings = date_range.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S').tolist()

# Convert the ts_hour column to datetime
for df in pnl_df_list:
    df['ts_hour'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ts_hour'])
```

### 2. Initial Data Filtering

Filtering the data to include only the period starting from `start_before_ema_long` to the initial date.

```python
ema_long_window = 11
start_before_ema_long = date_range[0] - pd.Timedelta(hours=ema_long_window)

dict_lagged_ahead_emg_long = {}
for crypto, df in zip(cryptos, pnl_df_list):
    df_filtered = df[(df['ts_hour'] >= start_before_ema_long) & (df['ts_hour'] < date_range[0])]
    df_filtered = df_filtered[['pnl']]
    dict_lagged_ahead_emg_long[crypto] = df_filtered
```

### 3. Setting Up Initial DataFrames

Initializing DataFrames to store the results for each cryptocurrency.

```python
dfs_result_list = [pd.DataFrame(columns=['pnl', 'EMA_short', 'EMA_long', 'is_positive', 'signal', 'count', 'consistency', 'is_continuous', 'class', 'weight_percentage', 'weight', 'weighted_pnl']) for _ in cryptos]

for i in range(len(cryptos)):
    dfs_result_list[i] = pd.concat([dfs_result_list[i], dict_lagged_ahead_emg_long[cryptos[i]]])
```

### 4. Generating Allocation Predictions

Using historical data to generate allocation predictions for the next period.

```python
window_params = {
    "BTC": {"short_window": 4, "long_window": 12},
    "ETH": {"short_window": 4, "long_window": 11},
    "ADA": {"short_window": 6, "long_window": 13},
    "DOGE": {"short_window": 6, "long_window": 14}
}

for i in range(len(date_strings) - 1):
    date_string = date_strings[i]
    next_date_string = date_strings[i + 1]
    pnl_df_list_for_date = [pnl_dict[crypto].loc[:date_string] for crypto in cryptos]
    next_hour_pnl_list = [pnl_dict[crypto].get(next_date_string, 0) for crypto in cryptos]

    df_to_update, allocation = generate_allocation_prediction(pnl_df_list_for_date, dfs_result_list, window_params)

    for i in range(len(cryptos)):
        dfs_result_list[i] = df_to_update[i]
    
    if len(allocation) != len(pnl_df_list):
        raise ValueError("Allocation length does not match the number of cryptocurrencies")
    if sum(allocation) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Sum of allocation is greater than 1")

    period_return = 0
    for j in range(len(allocation)):
        weighted_pnl = allocation[j] * next_hour_pnl_list[j] if next_hour_pnl_list[j] > 0 else 0
        cumulative_return_list[j].append(weighted_pnl)
        period_return += weighted_pnl

    cumulative_return = cumulative_return * (1 + period_return)

    print(f"next_hour_pnl_list: {next_hour_pnl_list}")
    print(f"cumulative_return_list: {cumulative_return_list[0][-1]}, {cumulative_return_list[1][-1]}, {cumulative_return_list[2][-1]}, {cumulative_return_list[3][-1]}")
    print(f"cumulative_return: {cumulative_return}\n")
```

## Explanation of the Allocation Strategy

### 1. EMA Calculation

EMAs are used to capture the trend of each cryptocurrency. The short and long windows for EMA calculation are determined through a grid search process to optimize the parameters for each cryptocurrency.

### 2. Weight Calculation

The weight for each cryptocurrency is calculated based on the EMA values and is adjusted based on the signal (buy/sell/hold).

### 3. Sharpe Ratio Calculation

The Sharpe Ratio is calculated for each cryptocurrency to measure its risk-adjusted return. Higher Sharpe Ratios indicate better risk-adjusted performance.

### 4. True Weight Allocation

The true weight for each cryptocurrency is calculated based on its Sharpe Ratio. The weights are then normalized to ensure the sum does not exceed 1.

### 5. Normalization

If the initial allocations exceed 1, the excess is subtracted from the highest allocation to normalize the weights.

### 6. Final Allocation and Execution

The final allocation is used to adjust the capital allocation for the next period. The strategy ensures that capital is allocated to assets with the highest expected return and lowest risk.

This strategy provides a robust framework for dynamic capital allocation based on historical performance and risk-adjusted metrics. By using trend-following indicators and optimizing parameters through grid search, the strategy aims to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
