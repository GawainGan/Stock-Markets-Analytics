    "# Capital Allocation Model - Data Science Coding Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Our trading strategy operates across various trading instruments. Among those trading instruments, the cryptocurrency futures market is a significant component. For this test, assume that our strategy is applied to four different cryptocurrencies. You will be provided with profit and loss (PnL) data for each of these cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a capital allocation strategy (e.g., a neural network, a statistical approach, etc.) that optimally allocate capital among different cryptocurrencies to maximizes the total returns.\n"

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Description**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each dataset `{crypto}.csv` contains hourly PnL data for a cryptocurrency.\n",
    "   - Columns in the dataset:\n",
    "     - `ts_hour`: Timestamp of the PnL data, incremented by one hour.\n",
    "     - `pnl`: PnL of our strategy for the cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Your Task**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Develop a strategy to allocate capital among the four cryptocurrencies to maximize cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Possible allocations for an hour include:\n",
    "     - Equal allocation (e.g., 25% each).\n",
    "     - Biased allocation (e.g., 80% to one cryptocurrency, 20% distributed among others).\n",
    "     - Zero allocation to any or all cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Due to the time limit to solve the test, let's simplify the problem by assuming:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You can rebalance your allocations as frequently as you wish with no additional trading cost.\n",
    "   - Allocation changes are immediate with no delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deliverables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A Jupyter notebook containing:\n",
    "     - Your capital allocation strategy.\n",
    "     - A brief explanation of your approach.\n",
    "   - A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary packages to run your notebook.\n",
    "   - Other necessary files such as model weights, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Criteria**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   We will evaluate the effectiveness of your model using a separate test dataset. Your strategy will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Accuracy**: How well does your strategy maximize returns?\n",
    "   - **Clarity**: Is your code well-documented and your approach clearly explained?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing Your Results**:\n",
    "   - You should provide a function `generate_allocation_prediction` that takes a list of historical PnL data of the four cryptocurrencies as input and outputs the allocation for the next hour.\n",
    "   - We will use the `evaluate_strategy` function that is provided to you in the notebook to test the effectiveness of your strategy on a separate test dataset."
